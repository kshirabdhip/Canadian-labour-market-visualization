## Canadian labour market visualization

Over the past few years, the Canadian labor force participation has been increasing as more and more immigrants and students are choosing Canada as their new home. So, a thorough understanding of the occupational information is of critical importance for everyone to start with a better career opportunity. In that regards, the National Occupational Classification (NOC), developed by Government of Canada, provides a systematic classification structure that categorizes the entire range of occupational activity in Canada. It classifies the occupations based on the work performed, as determined by the tasks, duties and responsibilities. However, the information is in textual format and not easily interpretable. In this Project, I am putting together a new way of visualizing the Canadian labor market data to decode the information which can be used in a range of contexts to compile, analyze and communicate information about occupations.

## Brief statistic of the labour market
### Occupational hierarchy: 
- 10 broad occupational categories 
- 40 major groups 
- 140 minor groups 
- 35,000 titles

## The project will address the below sub-objectives:

•	Distribution of employment income of the employed labor force
•	Proportion of each occupation category to the total job market
•	Distribution of jobs by Canadian provinces and cities
•	Classification of Job types by education and skill levels
